July 2014
Fixed a few small memory leaks, and enabled virtual http protocol by default.  Also disabled DTCP/IP.
The DTCP/IP will be enabled after we get the key store from the STB hardware.  
Made numerous changes to the libsouphttpsrc as well so that seek events will work when the GST FORMAT 
is time.  The default format of Bytes will work by default.
